      <h1>ABOUT ME!!</h1>
      <p>My name is Marady, pronounced Mar-ugh-dee and I go by she/her pronouns. 
         I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington 
         and I am so proud to be from this magical place. 
         I have one amazing son and a loving husband! 
         My job experience mostly is in social work and service. I was
         a housing case manager for 4 years, in those years my focus was helping
         adults in crisis and addiction. 
         My goal for the next year is to have power in knowledge. In my 
         next career venture I hope to be working in Software Development as a front or back end developer.
